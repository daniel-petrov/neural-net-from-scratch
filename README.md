# Neural Network from Scratch in Python
The purpose of this project is to get a thorough understanding of how nerual networks are made, trained and used. I will be following [this](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/building-a-neural-network-from-scratch-using-python-part-1-6d399df8d432) tutorial. Once the tutorial is complete, I will attempt to make another neural network to predict something else.
